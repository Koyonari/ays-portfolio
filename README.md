# Welcome to An Yong Shyan - Portfolio

<p>This responsive portfolio serves as a showcase of my journey and aspirations to become a full stack developer, as well as an insight into who am I as a person. This is my first experience working on a personal project with React.js and TailwindCSS, which was self-taught, marking my beginning of my exploration into modern web development.
